A fully responsive and simple Amazon-style e-commerce clone developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (without any framework or backend). The project demonstrates how to create a shopping site interface with product listings, cart functionality, checkout system, and persistent data using `localStorage`.

## How It Works

- Product data is stored in `products.js` as a JavaScript array
- The `amazon.html` page renders the product listing dynamically
- When a user clicks “Add to Cart,” the product is stored in the cart (JavaScript array)
- Cart data is saved to `localStorage` and automatically loaded on other pages
- The `checkout.html` page reads the cart data and calculates the total amount
